h1. jQuery.blockify

This plugin can be used to make any element clickable based on a child anchor. It is, in essence, the same as HTML5's ability to wrap anchor tags around block elements.

You can have multiple links inside the container element that will act as normal anchor tags as you can specify which links anchor is to be used when the parent is clicked. You can also easily ignore form elements (or anything else).


h2. Options:

* selector: 'a:last',			//	selector to specific anchor to be used when parent is clicked.
* cursor: 'pointer',			//	sets css cursor value. set to false to do nothing.
* hoverClass: 'hover',		//	class attached to element on hover for styling purposes.
* externalClass: 'ext'		//	if target anchor has this class, link will be opened in a new window.
* ignore: 'a, input, textarea, label, button'   //  clicking on these elements will not trigger the selected link.
